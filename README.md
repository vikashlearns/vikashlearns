## 🌐 About Me
I’m Vikash, a DevSecOps and Cloud Engineer with over a decade of experience. I specialize in automating secure infrastructure deployments and building scalable CI/CD pipelines. Currently, I’m enhancing my skills in **CyberArk**, **HashiCorp** tools, and mastering Cloud-Native environments.

🔧 I enjoy:
- Designing secure CI/CD pipelines with Jenkins, GitHub Actions, and ArgoCD.
- Automating infrastructure with **HashiCorp Terraform** and **Ansible**.
- Creating and managing containerized applications with Docker and Kubernetes (AWS EKS).
- Implementing secure secrets management with **CyberArk** and **HashiCorp Vault**.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **CI/CD**: Jenkins, GitHub Actions, ArgoCD, CircleCI  
- **Containers**: Docker, Kubernetes (EKS, AKS, GKE)  
- **IaC**: **HashiCorp Terraform**, **Ansible**, Helm  
- **Security**: **CyberArk**, **HashiCorp Vault**, Trivy, SonarQube, SailPoint  
- **Cloud**: AWS (EKS, EC2, S3, RDS), Azure (AKS, Functions), GCP  
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus, Grafana, ELK Stack, Datadog  
- **Version Control**: GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket
